     *
     * @classDesc The `MeasurementLevel` class is **a refinement of** the
     * [String]{@link pentaho.type.String} simple type that represents a **Level or Measurement**,
     * as understood by [S. S. Steven]{@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement}.
     *
     * Currently, the following measurement levels are supported:
     *
     * * `nominal` - A _qualitative_ measurement level.
     *   The lowest in the hierarchy of levels of measurement.
     *   A **nominal** visual role represents data visually preserving the
     *   distinction between different things and also, possibly,
     *   enabling easy association of different, but somehow similar, things.
     *   However, a nominal visual role represents data in a way that conveys no
     *   preferential order between the various things.
     *
     *   An example nominal visual role would be one that used the _color hue_ of
     *   distinct visual marks for representing things.
     *
     *   Any data type can be represented by a nominal visual role.
     *
     * * `ordinal` - A _qualitative_ measurement level.
     *   An **ordinal** visual role adds to the characteristics of
     *   nominal visual roles the ability to convey order to the represented things.
     *
     *   An example ordinal visual role would be using 5 shades of a same color hue
     *   to represent the 5 distinct values of a qualitative data property.
     *
     *   Any data type can be represented by an ordinal visual role,
     *   even if order needs to be attributed by some external mechanism
     *   (natural/source order, alphabetic, order by other property,
     *    explicit given order of values).
     *
     * * `quantitative` - Aggregates the _interval_ and _ratio_ levels of measurement,
     *    the highest in the hierarchy of levels of measurement.
     *    A **quantitative** visual role adds to the characteristics of ordinal visual roles
     *    the ability to visually represent the proportion between quantities (ratios),
     *    or, at least, the proportion between differences of quantities (intervals).
     *
     *    Only the {@link pentaho.type.Number} and {@link pentaho.type.Date} data types
     *    can be (directly) represented by a quantitative visual role.
